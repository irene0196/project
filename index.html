            <h2>Why New Zealand</h2>
            <h3>New Zealand, the home of the Maori culture</h3>
            <p>
              Māori culture forms a distinctive part of New Zealand culture and,
              due to a large diaspora and the incorporation of Māori motifs into
              popular culture, it is found throughout the world. Tikanga Māori
              is a set of cultural values, customs, and practices. This includes
              concepts such as what is sacred, caring for your community, rights
              to land by occupation, and other relationships between people and
              their environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Māori language is known as te reo Māori, shortened to te reo
              (literally, "the language"). At the beginning of the twentieth
              century, it seemed as if te reo Māori, as well as other aspects of
              Māori life, might disappear. government-sponsored schools (Kura
              Kaupapa Māori) began to teach in te reo, educating those with
              European as well as those with Māori ancestry.
